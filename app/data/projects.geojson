As part of our commitment to avoid duplicating the good work of others, SECAS builds on existing datasets wherever possible, often using them in innovative ways to help the conservation community make the best of the resources we already have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo start, staff pulled together sea turtle and marine mammal models from the Gulf of Mexico Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (GoMMAPPS), marine highly migratory fish models from the European Commission Joint Research Centre, and deep-sea coral models from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). One obvious gap was hardbottom habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo better represent Gulf hardbottom in the Southeast Blueprint, SECAS staff combined a suite of different data sources into a new indicator, including sediments from usSEABED; artificial reef, shipwreck, and deep-sea coral locations from NOAA; hardbottom and associated species data from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; and others. Recognizing that this first attempt at a Gulf hardbottom indicator had plenty of room for improvement, staff refined their approach in 2024 and convened a team of 15 experts to review the data and methods. As a result, the 2024 indicator uses better artificial reef and shipwreck data, incorporates new coral and hardbottom locations from the state of Florida and The Nature Conservancy, improves consistency with the Atlantic hardbottom indicator, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn future updates, SECAS staff hope to incorporate GoMMAPPS seabird models into the Blueprint as they become publicly available. The Blueprint will continue to improve its coverage of the Gulf marine environment and the rest of the SECAS geography through its annual revision cycle, incorporating the latest data and feedback from new partners.\u003c/p\u003e","photo":"FlowerGardenBanksNMS_NOAA.jpg","caption":"Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of TX. \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/noaaphotolib/40023571631/\"\u003ePhoto\u003c/a\u003e: G.

They also provide valuable habitat for birds, fish and shellfish, sea turtles, and more. In the absence of human development, the coastline constantly shifts in response to waves and weather, allowing it to sustain the ecosystem services we rely on. Urban growth and shoreline armoring try to hold this dynamic system in place, causing habitat loss and making our coasts more vulnerable to erosion and sea-level rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo encourage the conservation of key coastlines and barrier islands, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act withdraws the availability of most new federal funding and financial assistance, such as flood insurance, within areas designated as part of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fws.gov/program/coastal-barrier-resources-act\"\u003eCoastal Barrier Resources System\u003c/a\u003e (CBRS). The CBRS contains about 3.5 million acres of wetlands and barrier islands that were mostly natural and undeveloped at the time of designation. The law adopts the sensible approach that the risk associated with development in these areas should be borne by private sector and not underwritten by the American taxpayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.fws.gov/story/studies-examine-cbras-effectiveness-saving-money-and-reducing-development\"\u003eThis system has proved effective\u003c/a\u003e in discouraging development in storm- and flood-prone locations; development rates (including shoreline armoring) within the CBRS are more than 75% lower than areas outside it. Additionally, the CBRS is effective in reducing federal disaster spending. One study found that the Act saved $9.5 billion between 1989 and 2013, and projects it may save as much as $108 billion by 2068!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFWS staff are using the Southeast Conservation Blueprint to help assess and communicate the benefits of the Act in the Southeast. The Blueprint prioritizes about 90% of the areas within the Southeast CBRS. Given that the Blueprint prioritizes 50% of the Southeast landscape overall, this highlights the regional conservation importance of the CBRS. The Blueprint is demonstrating how the CBRS helps prevent the loss of habitat that is important for resilience and connectivity.\u003c/p\u003e","photo":"BigPineKeyFloridaKeys_ThomasFlickr.jpg","caption":"Sunrise at Big Pine Key in the Florida Keys. \u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/photommo/26654339601/in/album-72157666270573071/\"\u003ePhoto\u003c/a\u003e: Thomas/Flickr, \u003ca href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\"\u003eCC BY-SA 2.0\u003c/a\u003e.","location":"point - in proposed CBRS additions on Big Pine Key; polygon - coastline buffer provided by Paul with CBRS","updated":"2024-08-13"}}]}
